1. What is a process? And how it is created? 
   - A process is an instance of a program in execution.  
     It consists of the program code (also called the text section), data, stack, heap, and various system resources such as file descriptors and memory space.
   - Each process has its own Process Control Block (PCB), 
     PCB is a data structure maintained by the OS to store essential information about a process.
     which stores information like process ID (PID), process state (New/Ready/Running/Waiting(Blocked)/Terminated),
     CPU state info (
      Program Counter - PC, 
      General Purpose Registers - register identifiers and their values, 
      Stack Pointer - SP (also a Register in CPU),
      Processor Status Word(PSW) -  Contains condition flags, mode (user/kernel), and interrupt status.
     ) and scheduling information(Process priority, Scheduling queue pointers, CPU time used, Other scheduling policies (like round-robin, priority-based, etc.)).
   - When a context switch occurs (i.e., switching from one process to another),
   the OS saves the CPU state (registers, program counter, etc.) of the current process into 
   its PCB and loads the saved state of the next process into the CPU

     • Very first processes in OS? 
      - Every process in an OS (except the very first process) always has a parent process.
      - The actual very first processes in OS are KERNEL-SPACE PROCESSES(also called kernel threads),
        they run before the very first USER-SPACE PROCESS in OS
      - The very first USER-SPACE PROCESS in an OS (init(older way)/systemd(modern way) in Linux, System Idle Process in Windows, and launchd in macOS) 
        is started after setting up essential kernel threads.
      - User-Space Processes Started After init: 
         1. System and Service Daemons - These processes run in the background to manage system tasks:
            - Logging Services(rsyslogd) - (logs system messages),
            - Device Management(udevd) - (handles plug-and-play devices),
            - Networking Services(NetworkManager, dhclient) - (for IP configuration),
            - Scheduled Jobs(cron or systemd timers) - (automates tasks),
            - Security Services(sshd - SSH server, firewalld - firewall management)
            - Inter-process Communication: dbus-daemon
            - Audio Services: pulseaudio, pipewire
         2. User Session Management: (Handles user logins and sessions)
            - Login Manager: getty or gdm, sddm, lightdm (for graphical login screens)
            - Shell Sessions: bash, zsh (command-line shells)
         3. Graphical User Interface (If the system has a GUI): 
            - Xorg / Wayland: Manages the graphical display
            - Window Manager: gnome-shell, plasmashell, xfwm4, etc.
            - Login Manager: gdm, sddm, lightdm
         4. User Applications (Automatically Launched)
            - Background Apps: System tray applications, update managers
            - Startup Applications: Any program configured to start at boot
      
      • Boot Sequence in Detail: 
         1. Firmware (BIOS/UEFI) initializes hardware
         2. Bootloader loads the kernel into memory
         3. Kernel initializes itself and starts kernel-space processes (kernel threads)
         4. Kernel starts the first user-space process (e.g., init/systemd, launchd, wininit.exe)
         5. User-space processes take over, launching system services and user applications

      • Process Tree Example (Linux with systemd) (User-space processes)
            systemd (PID 1)
            ├── udevd (Device management)
            ├── NetworkManager (Handles network connections)
            ├── cron (Runs scheduled tasks)
            ├── gdm (Graphical login manager)
            │   ├── Xorg (Graphical display server)
            │   ├── gnome-shell (User interface)
            ├── sshd (SSH server)
            ├── bash (User shell)

      • Process Creation Steps:
         1. Parent process initiates creation 
            - A new process is usually created by an existing process 
         (called the parent process) using system calls like fork() in Unix/Linux or CreateProcess() in Windows.
         2. Memory Allocation
            - The OS allocates memory for the new process, including space for its code, stack, heap, and data.
         3. Loading the Program into Memory
            - If the new process needs to run a different program, the OS loads the executable file into memory using system calls like exec() in Unix.
         4. Assigning Unique Process ID (PID) 
            - The OS assigns a unique Process ID (PID) to the new process for identification.
         5. Initializing PCB (Process Control Block)
            The OS creates and initializes the process’s PCB, storing details such as:
            - Process ID (PID)
            - Parent process ID
            - Process state (Ready, Running, Waiting, etc.)
            - CPU state info(PC, SP, PSW, General purpose register identifiers and their values)
            - Memory management information/Scheduling information
         6. Adding to the Process Scheduler - The new process is placed in the Ready Queue, waiting for CPU execution.
         7. Process Execution Starts 
            - The OS scheduler picks the process from the ready queue and assigns CPU time.

      • Process Creation Methods
         1. Fork-Exec Model (Unix/Linux)
           - fork() creates a child process that is an exact copy of the parent.
           - exec() replaces the process’s memory with a new program.
         2. Windows Process Creation
           - Uses CreateProcess() to create a new process with a specified program.
         3. Thread-Based Process Creation
           - Instead of creating a full process, multi-threading allows creating 
             lightweight threads inside an existing process.

      Example of user-space process creation (Spotify):
         1. If Opened from the Terminal (Linux/macOS)
           - Parent process: Terminal shell (bash, zsh, etc.)
           - Example process tree:
               bash (PID 1234)  # Terminal shell
                ├── spotify (PID 5678)  # Spotify launched from terminal
         2. If Opened from Desktop (Linux/macOS/Windows): 
           - Linux (GNOME, KDE, etc.):
               gnome-shell (PID 3456)  # GNOME Desktop
               ├── spotify (PID 7890)
           - Windows:
               explorer.exe (PID 2345)  # Windows GUI
               ├── spotify.exe (PID 6789)  # Spotify
         3. If opened on startup (Autostart)   
            - Parent process: System service (systemd, launchd, etc.)
              systemd (PID 1)
               ├── gnome-session (PID 2345)
               │   ├── spotify (PID 6789)


1️⃣.  Memory layout of process (process structure in a UNIX-based OS environment)

## General Multi-Threaded Process Memory Layout
- Each process has a virtual memory space divided into different segments. Some of these segments are shared among all threads, while others (like the stack) are unique to each thread.

HIGH MEMORY (Largest Addresses) (e.g., 0xFFFFFFFF)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
|  KERNEL SPACE (NOT directly Accessible to Process)   |  <-- Managed by OS - shared by all processes. (KERNEL SPACE is not part of the process, it belongs to the OS)
|  - System calls, device drivers, memory management   |   When a process needs to interact with the kernel (e.g., file I/O, networking, memory management), it must use system calls (like read(), write(), mmap())

|  - Private to Main Thread                            |
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
|  HEAP (Grows Up)                                     |  Dynamic
|  - Stores dynamically allocated memory (`malloc`)    |  Read-Write (rw-)

LOW MEMORY (Smallest Addresses) (e.g., 0x00000000)

2️⃣. Heap (Grows up) theoretically can collide with stacks(Grows down in memory)

   - Modern OS's implement protections to prevent this from happening:
   1. The OS ensures there’s enough gap between the heap and stacks to prevent overlap
      - If the heap gets too large, the OS moves it using mmap() instead of sbrk().
   2. The OS places a guard page (a small protected memory region) below each stack.
      - If a stack overflows into this guard page → segmentation fault happens before the heap is reached.
   3. 🔹 Heap Allocations Use mmap() When Large
      - If malloc() requests a very large chunk of memory (e.g., >128KB), it doesn’t use the normal heap.
      - Instead, it allocates memory using mmap(), which places the memory elsewhere, avoiding stack collisions.

    🔹 What Happens If a Collision Occurs?
    1. Segmentation Fault (SIGSEGV)
       - If the stack overflows into protected memory, the OS terminates the process.
    2. Silent Memory Corruption (Rare, but Dangerous)
       - If protections are disabled (e.g., custom memory management), the heap might overwrite the stack or vice versa, causing random crashes.
    3. Heap Allocation Failure
       - If the heap tries to expand but there’s no space, malloc() returns NULL, and your program should handle this.

     - Continuous - Uninterrupted, without breaks, can be conceptual. Time is continuous (it keeps flowing without gaps).
     - Contiguous - Physically adjacent, touching, with no gaps. Books on a shelf placed contiguously (no space between them)

8️⃣. What is Virtual Memory? It's components and how it works? Virtual Memory and performance?
    How it solves these problems (#Memory not enough, #memory fragmentation(external) (holes in the address space), #security) ?

   - Virtual memory is a MEMORY MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUE used by OS 
     to give the appearance of a large, continuous block of memory to processes (while actually being non-contiguous),
     even if the physical memory (RAM) is limited.
   - The OS divides Virtual Memory into pages and maps them to physical frames, 
     which can be scattered across RAM (not stored continuously) - solves memory fragmentation problem.
     This means a process's memory is NOT actually in a single continuous block in RAM — 
     it's spread out, but the process sees it as one large, continuous block thanks to the OS and MMU.


   - Virtual memory enables multiprogramming by allowing processes to run without being fully loaded into RAM.
     Multiprogramming is when the OS keeps multiple processes in memory at the same time to improve CPU utilization.
   - Virtual memory enables processes to exceed physical memory by 
     storing inactive data on disk and loading only needed parts into RAM
   - Allows processes to use more memory than physically available (by using disk storage)
   - Provides protection so that processes cannot access each other's memory.
   - Enable efficient multitasking by swapping memory in and out as needed.
   
   • What Virtual Memory does in general?
     - Gives each process its own address space (process/memory isolation). 
       Then this address space is divided into segments (Stack, Heap, BSS, Data, Text).
       Each of these segments is further divided into fixed-size pages.
       Then those fixed-size pages are represented in the PAGE TABLE as mappings of virtual pages to physical frames. 
       (Virtual pages and physical frames always have the same size.  OS sets the page/frame size at boot time)
       Then PAGE TABLE is managed by OS (creates page tables, updates it, and handles faults) 
       and MMU(reads the page table and performs real-time address translation)

   • How Virtual Memory works ? (1)
      1. When a process starts, its virtual address space — comprising segments like the code (text) segment, 
        data segment, stack, and heap—is allocated by the OS and divided into fixed-size pages. 
        However, not all of these pages are loaded into RAM right away; only a small portion of the pages are initially loaded, 
        while the rest remain on disk (in the swap/page file), ready to be loaded into RAM on demand as the process executes and accesses them(Demand Paging). 
        (Offloading not immediately needed pages to disk and dynamically swapping pages(paging out) 
        to disk to fetch required pages from disk for process solves "Memory not enough" problem)
      2. When a process tries to access a virtual page that is not in RAM, a PAGE FAULT occurs. This happens when:
        The process is trying to execute a piece of code that resides in a virtual page that has been swapped 
        out to disk because it wasn't actively needed in RAM.
        The OS has moved this page to the swap file or page file (on disk) to make room for other pages.
      3. Once the page fault occurs:
         The MMU detects that the required page is not in RAM and triggers the OS to handle it.
         The OS checks the Page Table, which keeps track of where each virtual page is located (whether it’s in RAM or swapped to disk).
         If the page is not in RAM, the Page Table will indicate that it's in the swap file.
      4. OS Loads the Page from Disk:
         The OS then loads the page from the swap file (or page file) on the disk into available RAM
         After loading, the Page Table is updated to reflect that the virtual page now maps to a physical frame in RAM.
      5. Execution Continues
         The process can now continue execution, as the requested page is in RAM, and the MMU translates virtual addresses to physical addresses seamlessly.


   • Virtual Memory Components (that make it work):
     1. Virtual Address Space → The logical memory seen by a process (e.g., 0x0000A3B4).
     2. Physical Memory (RAM) → The actual memory in the system.
     3. Page Table → A mapping table that translates virtual addresses to physical addresses.
     4. Memory Management Unit (MMU) → Hardware that performs address translation using the page table.
     5. Paging Mechanism → Divides memory into fixed-size pages (virtual pages & physical frames).
     6. Page Fault Handling → A mechanism that loads missing pages from disk when accessed.
     7. Swap Space (Page File) → A portion of the disk reserved to store memory pages temporarily when physical RAM is full.
     8. TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) → A cache that speeds up virtual-to-physical address translation.
     9. Demand Paging → Loads pages into memory only when needed, reducing RAM usage.
     10. MMU (Memory Management Unit) - CPU part responsible for converting virtual addresses to physical addresses.

   • How Virtual Memory Works? (2)
     - When a process starts, the OS creates its virtual address space (virtual memory space).
     - The OS allocates memory for different segments of process (code, stack, heap, data) on RAM (physical memory).
     - The process always sees virtual addresses, while the OS & MMU handle mapping to physical memory.
     - When a process accesses memory, the following steps happen:

       1. The process generates a virtual addresses (Virtual addresses are generated at runtime)

          Memory Region               | How Virtual Addresses Are Generated?       | Example Address
          ----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------
          Code Segment (Text Section) | CPU fetches instruction                    | 0x400560
          Stack (Local Variables)     | Stack pointer decrements                   | 0x7ffdd3b4a2c8
          Heap (malloc)               | OS assigns a page from heap                | 0x563a9f4b2010
          Data Segment (Globals)      | OS assigns memory on process start         | 0x601040

       2. The MMU (Memory Management Unit) translates the virtual address to a physical address using the page table.
       3. If the page is in RAM, it retrieves the data.
       4. If the page is not in RAM (page fault), the OS loads it from disk (swap space or page file).

   • Virtual Memory and performance:

9️⃣. What is a PAGE TABLE? And how it works and why it is needed ?
   - Page Table is a data structure used by the operating system to map virtual addresses to physical addresses in a paged memory system.
   - Page Table is stored in RAM and managed by the Memory Management Unit (MMU) of the CPU.
   - Page table is a crucial part of virtual memory management 
   - Each process has its own page table.
   - Each page table contains entries (Page Table Entries - PTEs).
   - Each entry maps a Virtual Page Number (VPN) to a Physical Frame Number (PFN) in RAM.
   📌 The actual pages (data) are stored in RAM or disk (swap space), not in the page table.

   Since modern systems use virtual memory, 
   processes use virtual addresses instead of direct physical addresses

   • Why the PAGE TABLE is needed ?
     - Translates Virtual Page Numbers (VPN) to Physical Frame Numbers (PFN)
     - Enables memory isolation for processes (process memory isolation - one process cannot access another process's memory).
       Each process has its own separate page table managed by OS and MMU.
     - Supports demand paging (loading pages into RAM only when needed)

   • How PAGE TABLE WORKS (per process) ? 
     1. When a process is created, the OS allocates a new page table for it
     2. The page table maps Virtual Page Numbers (VPN) to Physical Frame Numbers (PFN).
     3. When the process accesses memory, the MMU checks the page table to find the physical address
     4. When a process is terminated, its page table is deleted, and its memory is freed.

    • How Does the Virtual Address(VA) Relate to the Page Table?
      - The virtual address is used as an input to the page table lookup.
      - Virtual Addresses are NOT stored anywhere.
      - A Virtual Address is created dynamically when the CPU accesses memory. 
        It’s just a number used to index the page table and find the actual physical address.
      - Virtual Address (VA) = [Virtual Page Number (VPN) | Page Offset]
                             = [       20 bits (VPN)      | 12 bits (Offset) ]

        NOTE: VA scheme above is for a 32-bit Virtual Address, 4 KB Page Size

    • Virtual address structure:
         1. PAGE NUMBER (Virtual) -> Identifies which page the virtual address belongs to
            - Page Number is also virtual because it is part of the virtual address.
            - Virtual Page Number (VPN) maps to Physical Phrame Number (PFN) in the Page Table. (VPN <--> PFN)
            This mapping is managed by the OS and used by the 
            Memory Management Unit (MMU - part of CPU) for address translation.

         2. PAGE OFFSET -> Specifies the exact location withing that page (of the page in Page Table)
            - Part of part of both virtual address and physical adress
            - Different CPU architectures may have different offset sizes depending on page size.
            - Same in Virtual and Physical memory

         •  PAGE SIZE is determined by the CPU architecture and the operating system
            - ARM (64-bit)	- Common Page Sizes: 4 KB, 16 KB, 64 KB
            - ARM (32-bit)	- Common Page Sizes: 4 KB, 64 KB
            - x86-64 (64-bit)	- Common Page Sizes: 4 KB, 2 MB, 1 GB
            - x86 (32-bit)	- Common Page Sizes: 4 KB, 4 MB
            - Terminal command: getconf PAGE_SIZE

         
      !!! Only the Page Number gets translated into a Physical Frame Number via the Page Table
            The Offset remains unchanged.

         • Example Virtual-to-Physical mapping: 

            Virtual Address  →  [Virtual Page Number] + [Offset]
                  ⬇ (Translation using Page Table)
            Physical Address →  [Physical Frame Number] + [Offset]

         • Example with 32-bit Virtual Address: 
            • Page size = 4 KB → Offset is 12 bits.
            • Virtual address is 32-bit → Remaining 20 bits are Page Number.

            Virtual Address (32-bit)
            --------------------------------------
            | Virtual Page Number (20 bits) | Offset (12 bits) |
            --------------------------------------

            Physical Address (PA)
            --------------------------------------
            | Physical Frame Number (20 bits) | Page Offset (12 bits) |
            --------------------------------------


      - Example code:
         int x = 24;
         printf("%p", &x); // virtual address of x is 0x16d9a2f08

10. What is IPC (Inter Process communication) ?
   And since processes are isolated by Virtual Memory(Paging, Segmenting), how the IPC is achieved?
   Elaborate on two main ways of IPC: 1. shared memory 2. message passing. 
   Is shared memory paged ?
11. Process memory layout has a Stack segment. CPU has Stack Pointer(SP), how it works ? 
12. Stack segment layout
