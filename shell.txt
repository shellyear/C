1. What is shell ? 

Shell = User-space program that acts as a command-line interface for interacting with the OS kernel.

- The shell is just a user-space program.
- It talks to the kernel using system calls (provided by kernel) to perform actions in user space.
- It doesn’t run in kernel space—it only requests services from the kernel when needed.
